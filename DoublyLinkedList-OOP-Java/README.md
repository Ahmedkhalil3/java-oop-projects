# DoublyLinkedList-OOP-Java

This project implements a custom **Doubly Linked List** in Java using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. It was completed as part of a Java challenge in the Tim Buchalka course on Udemy.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Abstract class `ListItem` to define the base structure of list nodes.
- Concrete class `Node` that extends `ListItem` and implements navigation and comparison logic.
- Interface `NodeList` to define the core behaviors (add, remove, traverse).
- `MyLinkedList` class implements the doubly linked list using the interface.
- Fully functional linked list supporting insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## ðŸ“š Concepts Used
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Interfaces
- Encapsulation
- Doubly Linked List

## ðŸš€ How to Run
Compile and run the `Main` class to test adding/removing elements from the custom linked list.
