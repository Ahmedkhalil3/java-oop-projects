# EmployeeSorter

A simple Java project demonstrating the use of:
- `record` classes
- local classes
- anonymous inner classes
- custom sorting using comparators

## 📌 Description

This project defines an `Employee` record with basic attributes: first name, last name, and hire date.  
Inside the `printOrderedList` method, a local class `MyEmployee` is used to calculate years worked and generate full names.

The program sorts a list of employees based on either:
- Full Name (alphabetically)
- Years Worked (in increasing order)

Sorting behavior is controlled by a parameter and handled using an anonymous comparator.

## 🧪 Features

- Java `record` for immutable data
- Local class defined within a method
- Anonymous class for dynamic comparator logic
- Clean and readable console output

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Copy the code into your local Java environment.
2. Compile with: `javac Main.java`
3. Run with: `java Main`

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Java Records
- Local Classes
- Anonymous Classes
- Comparator Interface
- List Sorting
